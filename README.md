# ehinter-2000-nogui
This is a remake of a python script I made a while back that takes an email, and turns it into a loosely encrypted version with asterisks.

I made this version to transition to the world of C/CPP.

to download, just find the EXE in the ehinter folder and download. Alternatively you can just compile it yourself using the source code.
